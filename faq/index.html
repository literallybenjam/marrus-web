    <h3>Is your name really Gô, like, G-O, like, the word?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes my name is really <i>Gô</i> do you really think I don't know my own name lol.
    <p>
      Okay actually my name is <i>Margaret</i> which got shortened to <i>Margo</i> which got shortened to just <i>Gô</i> because my friends are incredibly lazy so now that's what I go by.
      I also go by <i>Kibigo</i> sometimes.

  <section id="diaresis">
    <h3>How do you pronounce your name? / Why is there a circumflex?</h3>
    <p>
      You pronounce it [ɡoʊ], like the English word.
      The circumflex is actually just there to distinguish it from the verb, because otherwise things like <q>Go get me a drink</q> become nigh-indecipherable from <q>Go, get me a drink</q> and that's just confusing.
      I chose to use a circumflex over other punctuation marks because (a) Gō-with-a-macron is a boy's name and I'm not a boy, (b) accents and diæreses don't really make sense for one-syllable words, and (c) it kinda looks like a hat and that's cute.
    <p>
      You can leave off the circumflex if you want it just makes things more confusing sometimes.

  <section id="qualifications">
    <h3>What are your qualifications?</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a BA in Gender Studies from Whitman College with a concentration in queer theory who did their senior thesis on queer identities in digital spaces.
      And while just because you're not a Math major doesn't necessarily mean you aren't good at math (I was <em>almost</em> a Math major and humbly speaking I am more qualified than some of the people who were), and just because you're not a Gender Studies major doesn't mean you don't understand gender, it's fair to say that since I <em>am</em> a Gender Studies major and did kinda dedicate four years of study to this stuff I probably know what I'm talking about there at least a little bit.
      I did work in technology, marketing, and communications for the student body while I was in college and also wrote opinion pieces in the student newspaper.
      I've been writing stories since I was literally six years old and have nearly all of them categorized and on file.
      You should ask me about them sometimes.

    <h3>Dude please give me your precise identity signifiers so that I can properly delineate you inside the vast multidimensional intersectionality matrix I have created inside my head.</h3>
    <p>
      This isn't really a question it's more of a request.
      Also no.

  <section id="site">
    <h3>How did you make this site?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML.
      Some CSS.
      A tiny bit of JavaScript just on the front page.
    <p>
      What, I'm serious.
    <p>
      It's hosted on GitHub Pages and uses Google Fonts for most of the font stuff but otherwise it's all classic hand-coded Interwebs despite its apparent elegance.
      Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/marrus-sh/marrus-web">browse the source</a> and maybe someday you can make cool websites too.
