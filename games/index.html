        <h2>Games</h2>
        <p>
            I've been working on programming games for five years now, although due to time constraints and schooling it has rarely resulted in a finished product.
            I work primarily in 2D with JavaScript + HTML <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, although I have also done work in C++ with SDL and experimented with WebGL.
            My latest project has been <a href="https://github.com/literallybenjam/jelli/">the Jelli Game Engine</a>, programmed in Literate CoffeeScript and viewable in full on the GitHub page.
            It's still very much in the prototype stage, but I've used it for some short demos already; for example, <a href="https://marrus-sh.itch.io/rain">rain</a>.
