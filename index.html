    <h2>Vague</h2>
    <p>
      I was reading college romances and I decided that I wanted better college romances so I decided to write a better college romance and that's <b><i>Vague</i></b>.
      <i>Vague</i> tells the story of a freshman girl named Violet Oliver who goes to a pretentious liberal-arts college with the intentions of achieving academic and financial success and finds people and relationships waiting for her there instead.
      It's experimental structuralist fiction which draws heavily on po√´tic resonance, comparative literature, and the lesser-known intricacies of the English language.
    <p>
      <i>Vague 01</i> has been released on <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/108497342-vague-a-college-romance">Wattpad</a> and <a href="https://kibigo.itch.io/vague-01">Itch</a>.

    <h2>Sevensi</h2>
    <p>
      So I like, totally created a language.
    <p>
      Now I know what you're thinking:
      <q>umm go i'm pretty sure any nerd with a random particle generator can make a language you just stick part A to part B and call it something</q> but this one's actually pretty cool.
      <b>Sevensi</b> [<span lang="art-x-osv-Sevi">ÙÅàçÙÅàâÙÅàíÙÅàçÙÅàë</span>] is a fictional language <small>(WIP)</small> designed for its distinct character and relative etymological independence.
      It has been in development off-and-on for roughly seven years and features a unique script and cultural and literary traditions.
    <p>
      By which I mean there's hypothetical classics like <i>Manifestation of Clarity</i> and <i>Romance of New Nation</i> and chronicled etymologies involving vowel shifts and consonant transformations.
      We can talk about dating texts based on whether they're written using active or passive constructions or employ the <i>-l</i> plural particle and we can examine the history of vowel harmonies and article agreement.
      It's all super interesting stuff, even to me, even though I've been there for every step of the way, which is the sign of a job well done imo.
    <p>
      Alongside the language proper, I've developed a number of tools necessary for proper language documentation and usage, such as <a href="http://langdev.xyz/documentation/standards/DP/0002.txt">the LREC file format,</a> the <a href="https://github.com/marrus-sh/langdev/tree/master/documentation/encodings/unicode">LANGDEV in Unicode specification,</a> and <a href="https://github.com/marrus-sh/langdev/tree/master/fonts/unifont">Unifont LANGDEV.</a>
      You can find a brief overview of the language on <a href="https://github.com/marrus-sh/langdev/tree/master/documentation/languages/jsv/osv">the LANGDEV Project</a> website, and a primer for the Classical branch of the language is forthcoming.

  <section id="lite">
    <h2>Lite!</h2>
    <p>
      <b><i>Lite!</i></b> is a lighthearted magical teen story about witches, demons, and saving the day.
      I'm not working on it directly at the moment, but the the <small>(non-canonical)</small> pilot episode has <a href="/lite/00/">been completed</a> and you can read it now if you want a taste of what this project will entail.
      It's probable that I'll begin <i>Lite</i> proper once <i>Vague</i> (<a href="#vague" target="_self">see above</a>) has run it's course.
