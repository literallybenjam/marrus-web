    <h2>Sevensi</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Sevensi</b> [<span lang="art-x-osv-Sevi">􁈍􁈉􁈒􁈍􁈑</span>] is a fictional language designed for its distinct character and relative etymological independence.
      It has been in development off-and-on for roughly seven years and features a unique script and cultural and literary traditions.
      Alongside the language proper, Go has developed a number of tools necessary for proper language documentation, such as <a href="http://langdev.xyz/documentation/standards/DP/0002.txt">the LREC file format,</a> the <a href="https://github.com/marrus-sh/langdev/tree/master/documentation/encodings/unicode">LANGDEV in Unicode specification,</a> and <a href="https://github.com/marrus-sh/langdev/tree/master/fonts/unifont">Unifont LANGDEV.</a>
      You can find a brief overview of the language on <a href="https://github.com/marrus-sh/langdev/tree/master/documentation/languages/jsv">the LANGDEV Project</a> website, and a primer for the Classical branch of the language is forthcoming.

  <section id="lite">
    <h2>Lite!</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Lite!</b> is a lighthearted magical teen story about witches, demons, and saving the day.
      The project is currently in something of an R&amp;D phase, as the kinks of the plotline and world get worked out and the first few issues are written.
      However, the <small>(non-canonical)</small> pilot episode has <a href="/lite/00/">already been completed</a> and you can read it now if you want a taste of what this project will entail.

  <section id="laboratory">
    <h2>Laboratory/Labcoat</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Laboratory</b> is a client-side script for interfacing with the API of <a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon">Mastodon,</a> an open-source social network.
      It's still in active development, and something of a work-in-progress.
      You can check it out, and read the source code, <a href="https://github.com/marrus-sh/laboratory">here</a>.
    <p>
      <b>Labcoat</b> is an alternative frontend built alongside and using Laboratory.
      It is programmed in React and can be run without needing a dedicated server, for example on GitHub pages.
