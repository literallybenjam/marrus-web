            <p>
                So <a href="?2016-10-03" target="_self"><time datetime="2016-10-03" title="03 October 2016">yesterday evening</time></a> instead of working and doing all the things I <em>wanted</em> to get done, I pretty quickly realized that my productivity levels were at about 0 and so instead downloaded and began from the beginning <i>The Witcher</i>, which is a game that I've tried starting a few times before but have never really found the time to get into proper.
                (<a href="https://twitter.com/bombsfall/status/782926847579398144">Scott Benson's decision</a> to pick up the third in the series reminded me that I had the first two waiting for me on Steam, and here we are.)
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>The Witcher</i> is one of those games that I always feel a little weird for liking, because, well, it's <i>The Witcher</i>.
                But it feels a really important niche for me, as an expansive fantasy adventure (à la <i>Dragon Age</i>) which (unlike <i>Dragon Age</i>) you can get away with not caring too much about.
                You're Geralt, you just lost your memory, you don't know who the fuck any of these people are and most of them don't like you anyway, so you just sorta mind your own business and do what needs to be done.
                This is a good thing when you're depressed and don't have the emotional energy to care about Leliana or Anders or Josephine or what-have-you.
                Take down the bad guys, get your reward, move on.
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole sex thing is… eh.
                Again, it's <i>the Witcher</i>.
                In all fairness, if your plan is to make a game where the player can bang lots of women and then leave them behind, explicitly stating from the outset that it's not possible for Geralt to carry <abbr title="Sexually Transmittable Infections">STIs</abbr> or cause pregnancy is a good thing in my book.
                And, y'know, if a peasant girl thinks he's cute and wants to get him in bed, I may not exactly be what one calls a <q>sex-positive feminist</q> but I know well enough that it's not my place to judge.
            </p>
            <p>
                And let's be real here.
                The Witcher has lots of cute women.
                I'm a lesbian, so cute women is a plus in my book.
                <small>[Insert discussion about how sexualization of women in video games assumes a phallic viewer here, but I digress.]</small>
                What I'm not such a fan of is cute women being continually victimized, refrigerated, taunted, abused, you name it, with very little agency of their own.
                I've only played through the first chapter so far, but imagine my disappointment at seeing Shani, who looks <em>totally badass</em> by the way, rendered completely incapable of defending herself against a few ruffians until good ol' Geralt shows up to save the day.
                Like come on guys, really now.
            </p>
            <p>
                But that's actually more a point about the male characters in the game than the women themselves, because in these instances the women aren't really much more than background texture for the male characters anyways.
                It speaks to the lack of creativity on the developers' part that, when faced with the question of <q>How do I make &lt;male character&gt; seem like a bad person,</q> so often their response is <q>Oh by making them a misogynist / harrasser / sexual assaulter</q> (at the expense of all the women in the game).
            </p>
            <p>
                This is, however, actually the only negative point I have to make about all of the characters in <i>The Witcher</i> being Really Quite Flat Actually.
                Aside from the fact that some of those characters abuse and torment women, <i>The Witcher</i> feels like a really cute anime where every character is identifiable by one exaggerated feature and maybe the colour of their hair.
                And I absolutely 100% think this is intentional; I mean, just <em>look at this dialogue:</em>
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img alt="“I'm so happy you're… back. When I saw you, all the feelings I tried to deny returned, stronger than ever…” — The Witcher" title="I'm so happy you're… back. When I saw you, all the feelings I tried to deny returned, stronger than ever…" src="images/%5B2016-10-04%5D%20Witcher.jpg">
            </figure>
            <p>
                It's <em>so cheesy it's adorable</em>.
                And this is where the Witcher really shines, because you don't really have to care that much about its world or the people in it, but they can still make you laugh with their silliness and they can still charm you with their good looks.
                (At least, the female ones can, as thus far all the men I've come across have been kinda bumbling idiots.)
                Which is why the whole sex&ndash;trading-cards thing doesn't actually bother me too much, because it's like <q>Hey, I met this adorable cutie; we hung out for a while and then went our separate ways, but here's something to remember them by.</q>
                And that's cool.
                I actually like that.
                My only complaint is that there's no <em>platonic</em> means of getting the card, and this kinda trivializes the whole thing into just a sexcapade&mdash;a <q>I won't remember you unless we banged,</q> sort of affair.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from the (adorably) shallow characters, the depth of storytelling is really good, and there are so many things that I noticed but didn't entirely pick up on until the very end of the chapter when all the pieces came together.
                This was a very satisfying feeling.
                <q>So <em>that's</em> why the dog was barking!</q>
                <q>So <em>that's</em> what was in that glass vial!</q>
                And so on.
                The combination of 2D characters and deep storytelling was something that I wasn't expecting, especially given the game's similarities to <i>Dragon Age</i>, which does the opposite (fleshed-out characters but predictable plotline).
                It really works and keeps the mood light but the story engaging.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I love fantasy games.
                Fantasy games are escapism in the most harmless sense:
                <q>Let's go have adventures and bond with interesting people and gain a deeper understanding of culture and human relationships while leaving behind the slow-moving struggles of the modern day.</q>
                Fantasy game tropes (aside from misogyny and racism, which let's be real are just games tropes) tend to be things like <q>Oh no we made this one character <em>too</em> awesome,</q> and <q>Guess what you get to fight dragons in this game too,</q> which are things I Don't Mind At All and actually would like more of in my life.
                So while <i>The Witcher</i> maybe fucks some things up, mostly it just makes me sad that we don't have more people out there working with this potential, and instead we get a million dark-and-gritty dystopian copypastas and what-have-you that nobody really cares about let's be real.
                I like games where you get to romp.
                <i>The Witcher</i> lets you romp (in more ways than one).
            </p>
            <p>
                Also I want more dashing portrayals of cute girls in my life because really now.
                Cute boys, too&mdash;but I don't want to set my expectations too high.

            <p>
                Today I was feeling somewhat depressed.
                I got a fair amount of work done on my <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-5">GBJam 5</a> project&mdash;not a huge amount, but enough to feel accomplished.
                I managed a fair bit yesterday so it's okay if I don't accomplish everything today.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://strip.villainette.com/20161003">This comic strip</a> was passed around today, which might be part of what got me feeling so down, but hits a lot of notes for where I'm at right now.
                Either you feel it or you don't; I'm not going to talk much more about it.
