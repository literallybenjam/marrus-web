                Wow so like… a lot has happened since <a href="?2016-10-04" target="_self"><time datetime="2016-10-04" title="04 October 2016">my last update</time></a>?
                Here are some highlights:
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I <a href="https://marrus-sh.itch.io/xi-ep" title="XI EP">finished my GBJam game</a>.
                It's super short and, like, <abbr title="no big deal">nbd</abbr>, but I worked with my friend Alec on the music and am pretty happy with how it turned out.
                I feel like it's kinda niche <abbr title="with respect to">wrt</abbr> games in general despite very much mimicing the original Metroid, since it's kinda a relaxed jump-around-and-explore capsule game and <abbr title="i don't know">idk</abbr> that there's much of a market for those.
                I like queueing it up and just running through it real fast (it only takes a few minutes), and find that really relaxing.
                But <abbr title="your milage may vary">ymmv</abbr>.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I broke out my tablet and spent literally three full days on a mediocre (B-) drawing, which allowed me to identify the aspects of my style that I feel need the most improvement and so now that's my plan for the remainder of the month.
                I'm running a bit behind because I've been playing catchup with sleep the past couple of days but hopefully I will get back on track and be able to make good progress.
                At the end of the month I'm planning on doing another drawing so we'll see how that turns out to tell if I actually was able to accomplish anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've had an idea for a comic stuck in my head for a month or two now and have a rough outline put together for the first four or five chapters.
                The plan is, once I'm happy enough with my art capabilities, to run a non-canon pilot chapter to give myself a sense for how long things will take and hopefully get others interested in the project.
                When that will happen is up in the air but obviously I'd like it to be sooner rather than later.
                After the pilot is released I'll probably sit on it for a little while and then come back with a fresh set of eyes if I decide I actually want to work on the full thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The working name for this project is <b>Lite</b>.
                I'll maybe post some concept art and the like once I get some more done on it.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I've also been working on music!
                I mean, not actually that much right now, but Alec and I have been sending GarageBand files back and forth and hopefully something will come from it.
                I'd like to get back into drumming so hopefully I will find time for that as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Less on the creating side and more in terms of listening, I finally got around to listening to My Chemical Romance's <i>The Black Parade</i> (it's its 10th anniversary this year!) and oh my gosh.
                I mean, on one hand it's probably good that I'm only now getting into it because I don't know if I would have understood it really when it first came out (I was only in sixth grade!) but on the other hand that is <em>such</em> a good album.
                I've also gotten back into <i>Paramore</i> by Paramore, <i>My Love Is Cool</i> by Wolf Alice, and <i>Imaginary Life</i> by Worriers, all of which are really good pop-punk/alt-rock albums that I really adore.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've created a couple of playlists recently as well:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ4INm63Z5mg5eIcFQ5VV6ssUiuCSwoYS"><i>💾🎙</i></a> is a collection of (some of) my favourite rap songs, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ4INm63Z5mhljpw6aCnr7iw1tHmDeJwy"><i>Butterflies Fall Forever</i></a> collects some of the best songs by the band He Is We.
                The latter of these playlists I listened to a <em>lot</em> junior year of college; the former is more what I've had on repeat of late.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I've basically pledged to make these last few weeks before the election (and then, until the end of the year) as positive as possible, because I really think we need that right now.
                Our political culture these days has become one of bitterness and resentment, which is understandable but can only ever be fruitfully directed towards deconstruction.
                And I've become convinced lately that deconstruction <em>isn't good enough</em>; we something positive to keep striving towards.
                I'm reminded of one of Prometheus Brown's lines (<abbr title="also known as">aka</abbr> Geologic) on Blue Scholars' <i>George Jackson</i>:
                <q>I'm sticking up the world, now, for everything it's worth.</q>
                There's so much value in the world and so many amazing and caring people, and we have a right to demand that it be cherished and brought forward.
                And, no matter how bleak things get, there will always be artists and creators working hard to create meaning in the darkness.
                It's the one thing we can always count on.
                And that alone is reason enough to keep marching.
            </p>
            <p>
                So yeah.
                I'm going to do my best to make, at the very least, <a href="https://twitter.com/marrus_sh/">my Twitter feed</a> (no guarantees with other social media) a celebration of the good and cute and caring and special and unique things that humanity has to offer, to hopefully give us all a little more energy as we move forward.
                That doesn't mean I'm not still gonna call out corporations or whoever when they <a href="https://twitter.com/marrus_sh/status/789291565424349185">fuck shit up</a>.
                But always, with an eye looking forward.
                Blue Scholars again, <i>Cornerstone</i>:
                <q>I speak solemnly; I seek equality; my people celebrate life despite poverty.</q>
                And as Shing02 says on <i>Luv(sic) Part 3</i>, <q>Whenever you are feeling blue, keep walking and we can get far. Wherever you are.</q>

            <p>
                So <a href="?2016-10-03" target="_self"><time datetime="2016-10-03" title="03 October 2016">yesterday evening</time></a> instead of working and doing all the things I <em>wanted</em> to get done, I pretty quickly realized that my productivity levels were at about 0 and so instead downloaded and began from the beginning <i>The Witcher</i>, which is a game that I've tried starting a few times before but have never really found the time to get into proper.
                (<a href="https://twitter.com/bombsfall/status/782926847579398144">Scott Benson's decision</a> to pick up the third in the series reminded me that I had the first two waiting for me on Steam, and here we are.)
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>The Witcher</i> is one of those games that I always feel a little weird for liking, because, well, it's <i>The Witcher</i>.
                But it fills a really important niche for me, as an expansive fantasy adventure (à la <i>Dragon Age</i>) which (unlike <i>Dragon Age</i>) you can get away with not caring too much about.
                You're Geralt, you just lost your memory, you don't know who the fuck any of these people are and most of them don't like you anyway, so you just sorta mind your own business and do what needs to be done.
                This is a good thing when you're depressed and don't have the emotional energy to care about Leliana or Anders or Josephine or what-have-you.
                Take down the bad guys, get your reward, move on.
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole sex thing is… eh.
                Again, it's <i>the Witcher</i>.
                In all fairness, if their plan was to make a game where the player can bang lots of women and then leave them behind, it's nice that they explicitly stated from the outset that it's not possible for Geralt to carry <abbr title="Sexually Transmittable Infections">STIs</abbr> or cause pregnancies.
                And, y'know, if a peasant girl thinks he's cute and wants to get him in bed, I may not exactly be what one calls a <q>sex-positive feminist</q> but I know well enough that it's not my place to judge.
            </p>
            <p>
                And let's be real here.
                The Witcher has lots of cute women.
                I'm a lesbian, so cute women is a plus in my book.
                <small>[Insert discussion about how sexualization of women in video games assumes a phallic viewer here, but I digress.]</small>
                What I'm not such a fan of is cute women being continually victimized, refrigerated, taunted, abused, you name it, with very little agency of their own.
                I've only played through the first chapter so far, but imagine my disappointment at (for example) seeing Shani, who looks <em>totally badass</em> by the way, rendered completely incapable of defending herself against a few ruffians until good ol' Geralt shows up to save the day.
                Like come on guys, really now.
            </p>
            <p>
                But that's actually more a point about the male characters in the game than the women themselves, because in these instances the women aren't really much more than background texture for the male characters anyways.
                It speaks to the lack of creativity on the developers' part that, when faced with the question of <q>How do I make &lt;male character&gt; seem like a bad person,</q> so often their response is <q>Oh by making them a misogynist / harrasser / sexual assaulter</q> (at the expense of all the women in the game).
            </p>
            <p>
                This is, however, actually the only negative point I have to make about all of the characters in <i>The Witcher</i> being Really Quite Flat Actually.
                Aside from the fact that some of those characters abuse and torment women, <i>The Witcher</i> feels like a really cute anime where every character is identifiable by one exaggerated feature and maybe the colour of their hair.
                And I absolutely 100% think this is intentional; I mean, just <em>look at this dialogue:</em>
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img alt="“I'm so happy you're… back. When I saw you, all the feelings I tried to deny returned, stronger than ever…” — The Witcher" title="I'm so happy you're… back. When I saw you, all the feelings I tried to deny returned, stronger than ever…" src="images/%5B2016-10-04%5D%20Witcher.jpg">
            </figure>
            <p>
                It's <em>so cheesy it's adorable</em>.
                And this is where the Witcher really shines, because you don't really have to care that much about its world or the people in it, but they can still make you laugh with their silliness and they can still charm you with their good looks.
                (At least, the female ones can, as thus far all the men I've come across have been kinda bumbling idiots.)
                Which is why the whole sex&ndash;trading-cards thing doesn't actually bother me too much, because it's like <q>Hey, I met this adorable cutie; we hung out for a while and then went our separate ways, but here's something to remember them by.</q>
                And that's cool.
                I actually like that.
                My only complaint is that there's no <em>platonic</em> means of getting the card, and this kinda trivializes the whole thing into just a sexcapade&mdash;a <q>I won't remember you unless we banged,</q> sort of affair.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from the (adorably) shallow characters, the depth of storytelling is really good, and there are so many things that I noticed but didn't entirely pick up on until the very end of the chapter when all the pieces came together.
                This was a very satisfying feeling.
                <q>So <em>that's</em> why the dog was barking!</q>
                <q>So <em>that's</em> what was in that glass vial!</q>
                And so on.
                The combination of 2D characters and deep storytelling was something that I wasn't expecting, especially given the game's similarities to <i>Dragon Age</i>, which does the opposite (fleshed-out characters but predictable plotline).
                It really works and keeps the mood light but the story engaging.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I love fantasy games.
                Fantasy games are escapism in the most harmless sense:
                <q>Let's go have adventures and bond with interesting people and gain a deeper understanding of culture and human relationships while leaving behind the slow-moving struggles of the modern day.</q>
                Fantasy game tropes (aside from misogyny and racism, which let's be real are just games tropes) tend to be things like <q>Oh no we made this one character <em>too</em> awesome,</q> and <q>Guess what you get to fight dragons in this game too,</q> which are things I Don't Mind At All and actually would like more of in my life.
                So while <i>The Witcher</i> maybe fucks some things up, mostly it just makes me sad that we don't have more people out there working with this potential, and instead we get a million dark-and-gritty dystopian copypastas and what-have-you that nobody really cares about let's be real.
                I like games where you get to romp.
                <i>The Witcher</i> lets you romp (in more ways than one).
            </p>
            <p>
                Also I want more dashing portrayals of cute girls in my life because really now.
                Cute boys, too&mdash;but I don't want to set my expectations too high.

            <p>
                Today I was feeling somewhat depressed.
                I got a fair amount of work done on my <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-5">GBJam 5</a> project&mdash;not a huge amount, but enough to feel accomplished.
                I managed a fair bit yesterday so it's okay if I don't accomplish everything today.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://strip.villainette.com/20161003">This comic strip</a> was passed around today, which might be part of what got me feeling so down, but hits a lot of notes for where I'm at right now.
                Either you feel it or you don't; I'm not going to talk much more about it.
