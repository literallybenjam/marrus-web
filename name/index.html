                    The need for persistent, human-readable, and publicly-knowable identifiers for individuals is well-documented.
                    These identifiers, commonly referred to as <q>names,</q> have been in use for millennia.
                    The exact implementation of these identifiers varies widely depending on culture, language, medium, and context, but this is far from a flaw&mdash;to the contrary, it is precisely this flexibility which allows names to function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of journalism and public personalities, however, contexts often collapse onto one another, and the correct name to use in a given situation is not always clear.
                    This can create severe ambiguities and confusion among readers, who might expect an individual to be referred to in one manner, only to find them instead referred to in another.
                    Moreover, respectful parties often wish to take the considerations of the individual being referred to into account, and some names may be considered offensive or less morally sound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This document puts forward the Best Current Practice regarding the management and deployment of names for referring to its author.
                    It lies somewhere between a standard and a style guide.
                    It is limited in scope only to those serving in official capacities, or public figures dealing with large audiences.
                    It may be cited and redistributed as necessary for implementation, but as a Living Document, it is always subject to change.

                        Whenever possible, a name from this section SHOULD be used.

                        The general-purpose full English name of this document's author is <b>Margaret Russel</b>.
                        This name SHOULD be used in general use-cases and in scenarios not covered by this specification, such as during introductions, in citations, and in daily conversation.
                        When it is unambiguous to do so, this name MAY be shortened to <b>Margaret</b>; however, within the context of citations, the full <b>Margaret Russel</b> SHOULD be used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the above full name, <i>Russel</i> is <em>not</em> a patronym, and MUST NOT be treated as a surname or appear on its own.
                        Bibliographies and other alphebetical lists MUST treat <b>Margaret Russel</b> as though it were a given name with two components, and not a given name followed by a surname.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The surname of this document's author is <b>Shoemake</b>, and the extended name <b>Margaret Russel Shoemake</b> MAY be used in situations where a style guide requires a surname to properly function.
                        Journalistic publications or academic works which commonly refer to individuals by last name after they have been introduced MAY use <b>Shoemake</b> for this purpose.
                        Similarly, a bibliographic citation MAY sort this name as <b>Shoemake, Margaret Russel</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The name <i>Margaret Shoemake</i>, while not disallowed by this document, is NOT RECOMMENDED for use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The origins of the surname <i>Shoemake</i> are French, and writers working in French MAY for stylistic purposes instead elect to use the name <b lang="fr">Marguerite de la Chaumette</b> to reflect this history.
                        However, the names <i lang="fr">Margaret de la Chaumette</i>, <i lang="fr">Margaret Russel de la Chaumette</i>, or <i lang="fr">Marguerite Russel de la Chaumette</i> MUST NOT be used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In informal settings, sometimes a nickname is preferred, and this document proposes <b>Marrus</b> (a portmonteau of <i><b>Mar</b>garet <b>Rus</b>el</i>) for this purpose.
                        This nickname is also manifested in the usernames <a href="https://twitter.com/marrus_sh"><b>@marrus_sh</b></a> (Twitter), <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marrus.sh"><b>/marrus.sh</b></a> (Facebook), and similar, all of which MAY be used as valid signifiers of this author (here the <i>sh</i> comes from the first two letters of <i><b>Sh</b>oemake</i>).
                        The name <b>marrus_sh</b> (or <b>marrus.sh</b>) MAY be used in used in some situations, and cited as such, as a signature or mark of authorship, but is NOT RECOMMENDED in prose.
