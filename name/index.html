                <p>
                    The need for persistent, human-readable, and publicly-knowable identifiers for individuals is well-documented.
                    These identifiers, commonly referred to as <q>names,</q> have been in widespread use across populations and cultures for millennia.
                    The exact implementation of these identifiers, however, varies widely depending on culture, language, medium, and context.
                    This is far from a flaw&mdash;to the contrary, it is precisely this flexibility which permits names such a universal function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of journalism and public personalities, however, contexts often collapse onto one another, and the correct name to use in a given situation is not always clear.
                    Furthermore, in the case of determining authorship, pseudonyms and other identifiers, as well as the fact that multiple authors may have the same name, can make the process of assigning names to works difficult (this problem has been addressed to some extent through the <a href="http://marrus.xyz/bns/">Branching Notational System</a>).
                    These facts can produce severe ambiguities and confusion among readers, who might expect an individual to be referred to in one manner, only to find them instead referred to in another.
                    Moreover, respectful parties often wish to take the considerations of the individual being referred to into account, and some names may be considered offensive or less morally sound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This document puts forward the Best Current Practice regarding the management and deployment of names in reference to its author.
                    Consequently, it lies somewhere in the space between a <i>standard</i> and a <i>style guide</i>.
                    It is limited in scope only to those serving in official capacities, or public figures dealing with large audiences.
                    It may be cited and redistributed as necessary for implementation, but as a Living Document, it is always subject to change.

                        The names in this section are the best and most recent names designated for public use.
                        Whenever possible, a name from this section <strong>should</strong> be used.

                    <p>
                        The full English general-purpose name of this document's author is <b>Margaret Russel</b>.
                        This name <strong>should</strong> be used in general use-cases and in scenarios not covered by this specification, such as during introductions, in citations, and in daily conversation.
                        When it is unambiguous to do so, this name <strong>may</strong> be shortened to <b>Margaret</b>; however, within the context of citations, the full <b>Margaret Russel</b> <strong>should</strong> be used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the above full name, <i>Russel</i> is <em>not</em> a patronym, and <strong>must not</strong> be treated as a surname or appear on its own.
                        Bibliographies and other alphebetical lists <strong>must</strong> treat <b>Margaret Russel</b> as though it were a given name with two components, and not a given name followed by a surname.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The surname of this document's author is <b>Shoemake</b>, and the extended name <b>Margaret Russel Shoemake</b> <strong>may</strong> be used in situations where a style guide requires a surname to properly function.
                        Journalistic publications or academic works which commonly refer to individuals by last name after they have been introduced <strong>may</strong> use <b>Shoemake</b> for this purpose.
                        Similarly, a bibliographic citation <strong>may</strong> sort this name as <b>Shoemake, Margaret Russel</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The name <i>Margaret Shoemake</i>, while not disallowed by this document, is <strong>not recommended</strong> for use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The origins of the surname <i>Shoemake</i> are French, and writers working in French <strong>may</strong> for stylistic purposes instead elect to use the name <b lang="fr">Marguerite de la Chaumette</b> to reflect this history.
                        However, for clarity's sake, the names <i lang="fr">Margaret de la Chaumette</i>, <i lang="fr">Margaret Russel de la Chaumette</i>, or <i lang="fr">Marguerite Russel de la Chaumette</i> <strong>must not</strong> be used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In informal settings, sometimes a nickname is preferrable to a full name, and this document proposes <b>Marrus</b> (a portmonteau of <i><b>Mar</b>garet <b>Rus</b>sel</i>) for this purpose.
                        This nickname is also manifested in usernames such as <a href="https://twitter.com/marrus_sh"><b>@marrus_sh</b></a> (Twitter), <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marrus.sh"><b>/marrus.sh</b></a> (Facebook), all of which <strong>may</strong> be used as valid signifiers of this author (here the <i>sh</i> comes from the first two letters of <i><b>Sh</b>oemake</i>).
                        The name <b>marrus_sh</b> (or <b>marrus.sh</b>) <strong>may</strong> be used in used in some situations, and cited as such, as a signature or mark of authorship, but is <strong>not recommended</strong> in prose.

                        However, the BNS ID <code>benjam.xyz (2016)</code> <strong>should not</strong> be used for referring to new documents.

                        (One possible exception to this rule is this author's <a href="https://github.com/literallybenjam">GitHub account</a>, which presently (as of <time datetime="2016-05-23">23 May 2016</time>) still uses <i>literallybenjam</i> for compatibility reasons.)
