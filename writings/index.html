        <p>
            I write things!
            I wrote for the school newspaper in when I was in college, and will hopefully post some of my articles from there up here eventually&mdash;but seeing as we have <em>both</em> changed our names since then it might be kinda a pain to track down.
            Contact me if you want to know more!

        <p>
            I also write fiction!
            I've got a few projects that I've been throwing around and slowly working on but fiction writing takes a long time ðŸ˜°.
            I do all my typesetting in XeLaTeX to make sure it looks good.
            You can read a chapter from something I'm working on <a href="/mn/" target="_self">here</a>, if you're interested.
