                I write things!
                I wrote for the school newspaper in college, and will post some stuff from there up here eventually&mdash;but seeing as we have <em>both</em> changed our names since then it might be kinda a pain to track down.
                Contact me if you want to know more!

                I also write fiction!
                I've got a few projects that I've been throwing around and slowly working on but fiction writing takes a long time ðŸ˜°.
                I do all my typesetting in XeLaTeX to make sure it looks good (a skill I picked up back from my prospective math major).
                You can read a chapter from something I'm working on <a href="/mn/" target="_self">here</a>, if you're interested.
